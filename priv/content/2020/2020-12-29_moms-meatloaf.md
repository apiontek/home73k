Preheat oven to 350

So as you know, I just throw my meatloaf together, but here are my estimates based on a bunch of published recipes:

- Put 2 pounds ground beef (80/20) in a large bowl.
- Squirt about 1/2 cup ketchup over it.
- Sprinkle about a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce over.
- Throw in one egg (or 2, if you feel the need - I usually just use one).
- Put in about 1 teaspoon horseradish
- Put in about 1 teaspoon mustard
- Sprinkle 1 packet of dry onion soup mix over
- I have used bread (2 slices soaked like you're making meatballs and squeezed out) or oats (about 3/4 cup), or sometimes both depending on what I have or need to use up

You don't need any extra salt, everything you put in is pretty salty, grind some pepper on top

If you like you can put in a bit of mild hot sauce like Franks, Crystal, Louisiana hot sauce

Mix and squish everything together with your hands really well (make sure you wash them first!) (I don't think Justine will like this part). (Some recipes say to only mix loosely, I disagree.) Mixture should be nice and soft, but not so soft that you can't form it into a loaf (not as soft as I do for meatballs). I don't use a loaf pan, I shape it into an oval loaf. Do this in the pan you'll bake it in and then you don't have to grease it.

Squirt more ketchup over top, and spread all over the loaf (I use the back of a teaspoon to do this).

I like to bake it in a cast iron skillet, easier to clean and also you can make gravy in it if you like.

Bake at 350 for about an hour and 15 minutes. Internal temp should be 160. Let it stand a few minutes before slicing and serving with the classic accompaniments of mashed potatoes and corn.

If you want to make a gravy, pour off most of the fat from the pan, stir in flour to make a roux, add unsalted broth (beef or chicken or vegetable), cook and scrape the good stuff from the bottom of the pan. Drippings are pretty salty so unsalted liquid is essential, keep adding till flavor suits you.

Well, now you know all my secrets!
