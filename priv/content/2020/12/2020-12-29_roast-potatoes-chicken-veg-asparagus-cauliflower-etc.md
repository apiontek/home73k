So simple, so easy, so good --- I often forget I can make this.

- 6ish chicken thighs
- 6ish potatoes
- bundle of asparagus

Preheat oven to 425

Lightly oil the chicken, add salt & pepper, maybe thyme, sage, etc. Roast the chicken 35-40 min, or until 165Â°

Wash & chop up the potatoes. Lightly oil them, and add, salt, pepper, thyme (use chicken oil if possible!). Roast them 25-30 min

Rinse the veggies, chop as needed. Lightly oil, add salt & pepper. Roast until done (about 15 min for asparagus).
