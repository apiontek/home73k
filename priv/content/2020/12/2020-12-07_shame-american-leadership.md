If you haven't read this yet, you should. But you're not going to feel good:

"[Headlines Donâ€™t Capture the Horror We Saw](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/12/new-york-doctors-know-how-bad-pandemic-can-get/617302/)" (subtitle: "I chronicled what COVID-19 did to a hospital. America must not let down its guard.")

<!--more-->

I'd blockquote something but it should really be read in full.

My partner shared this experience as a nurse at a big NY hospital.

It's abominable that this was allowed to get so bad, and allowed to continue across the country, and is being allowed to get so bad again.

Shame on our leadership. Shame on America.
