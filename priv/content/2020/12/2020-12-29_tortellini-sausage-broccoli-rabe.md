Another good meal prep.

We use frozen cheese tortellini. Can use frozen broccoli, but broccoli rabe is preferred.

Brown the sausage; cook the greens w/olive oil, garlic, salt, red pepper flakes; steam the tortellini on the bed of greens. Ok to add a little water if needed, frozen veg usually more watery than fresh.
